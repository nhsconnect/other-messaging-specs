            </p>
            <p>When constructing a positive response to a received GP2GP Message no numeric error code is used, however the typeCode is used as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <tt>&lt;acknowledgement typeCode = "AA"&gt;</tt>
            </p>
            <p>In this case the ControlActEvent will not contain a 'reason' element</p>
            <p>
               <i>Negative Responses</i>
            </p>
            <p>When constructing a negative response to a received GP2GP Message the table of numeric codes in section 3 are available for use.</p>
            <p>Here the Acknowledgement.typeCode is used as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <tt>&lt;acknowledgement typeCode = "AE"&gt;</tt>
            </p>
            <p>In addition the ControlActEvent.reason should be populated as follows (using the relevant code from the table, as highlighted in blue below):</p>
