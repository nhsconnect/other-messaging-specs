<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="section1_2">
<p>A generic vocabulary name acting as a placeholder for a number of specific response code vocabularies that identify issue and error codes. Some of the specific vocabularies are published in this MiM, while others are externally maintained and are available from a location detailed in the list below.</p>
