Example: the report writer, the person writing the act definition, the guideline author, the placer of an order, the EKG cart (device) creating a report etc. Every Act should have an author. Authorship is regardless of mood always actual authorship. The author (or authors) has ownership of the Acts that they originate. This means that a party other than this author (or those authors) cannot cancel, abort, complete or modify the state or content of this Act in any other way. A party other than the author may only amend, reverse, override, replace, or follow up in other ways on this Act, whereby the Act remains intact and is linked to another Act authored by that other party.</p>

Need not be the principal responsible actor, e.g. a surgery resident operating under supervision of attending surgeon, and may be the patient in self-care, e.g. fingerstick blood sugar. The traditional order filler is a performer. This information should accompany every service event.</p>
