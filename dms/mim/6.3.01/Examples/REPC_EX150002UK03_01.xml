								<p>
        Mr Parker is a somewhat socially awkward young man, an observation explained by
        the loss of his parents at an early age and and his subsequent habitation with his
        elderly aunt and uncle.
    </p>
								<p>
       Alas, Peter has also recently lost his Uncle Ben, who was his legal guardian for much
       of his life, in a carjacking incident in the city.
    </p>
								<p>
        Mr Parker has been considering a laser keratectomy as treatment for his extreme
        myopia and has been referred to Mr Terence Hill, an opthalmic surgeon, for consultation.
    </p>
								<p>
        Patient has sustained a spider bite to the interdigital web between thumb and first
        digit on right hand. Area is inflamed and swollen.
    </p>
								<p>
        Patient has become tolerant to extreme levels of exercise previously abnormal for
        him.
    </p>
								<p>
        Patient has demonstrated the ability to climb even sheer surfaces.
    </p>
								<p>
        Patient can also jump great distances from a standing start.
    </p>
								<p>
       Peter also manifests the ability to detect dangerous circumstances with 
       a minimum or total absense of traditional sensory cues.
    </p>
								<p>
        Peter has become unusually sensitive to the insecticide that his aunt May uses to
        treat the aphid infestation on her roses. It makes him drool excessively, his eyes
        water, and he loses control of his excretory functions. Tentative diagnosis is an
        organophosphate allergy. Advised patient to tell Aunt May to lay off the Malathion.
    </p>
								<p>
         Peter has always suffered from hay fever, and this continues regardless of his other symtoms.
    </p>
