<!--
PSIS Patient query response example (DPA Subject Access Query Response).

This is the response to a "get full case" call. It contains
all the events for a given patient, with the original HL7 for each one.
The expected use case for this is responding to a Data Protection Act
request to return all data that is stored in PSIS for a given patient.

The format of this response is almost identical to the "queryResponseEvent"
(get event by event ID), but contains all events for a patient rather than
a single event.

The metadata elements of this response are in the "urn:npfit:psisqr"
namespace, with the "psis" prefix. The original HL7 of the event is in the
"urn:hl7-org:v3" namespace, with no prefix.
