PSIS Event query response example.

This is the response to a "get event by event ID" query. It contains
a single event, with its original HL7.

The format of this response is almost identical to the "queryResponsePatient"
(getFullCase), but it is constrained to contain only a single event rather
than all events for the patient.

The metadata elements of this response are in the "urn:npfit:psisqr"
namespace, with the "psis" prefix. The original HL7 of the event is in the
"urn:hl7-org:v3" namespace, with no prefix.
