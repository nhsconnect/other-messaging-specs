Each Use Case has a description which describes the functionality that will be built in the proposed system. A Use Case may 'include' another Use Case's functionality or 'extend' another Use Case with its own behaviour.
Use Cases are typically related to 'actors'. An actor is a human or machine entity that interacts with the system to perform meaningful work.</TD>
