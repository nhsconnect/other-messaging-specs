								<h3>
									Summary</h3>
								<p>Dr Fixit is called to visit Frank Smith. Frank
                was registered with another practice in the local
                area but his family have decided they were not
                happy with the care he was receiving. Dr Fixit has
                agreed to take him as a patient. He goes to see him
                on a home visit.</p>
								<h3>
									Detail</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Prior to going on the home visit Dr Fixit
                  calls up Frank’s record. He has no record of
                  his own as he is a new patient. There has been no
                  GP2GP transfer as Frank’s old GP did not keep
                  computerised records. The paper record has yet to
                  arrive.</li>
									<li>Dr Fixit arrives at Frank’s home he notices
                  that the house is in a state of disrepair, he
                  hears a dog barking.</li>
									<li>Dr Fixit rings the door bell, the dog
                  continues to bark and there is no answer.</li>
									<li>Dr Fixit decides to try the door, he opens it
                  slightly and the dog sticks his nose out. Dr
                  Fixit is confident around dogs so he calms the
                  dog and walks in.</li>
									<li>Inside he finds Frank in a back room sitting
                  in front of the TV which is turned up high.</li>
									<li>He manages to attract Frank’s attention and
                  the TV is turned off.</li>
									<li>Dr Fixit spends time talking to Frank. Frank
                  appears to be mildly confused. He is surprised
                  that his dog has not gone for the doctor. He says
                  that last week he bit the post man.</li>
									<li>Dr Fixit asks if Frank is taking any
                  medication or is seeing any other Health
                  professional. Frank says that he was in the Local
                  Mental Health hospital about 10 years ago.</li>
									<li>Dr Fixit is worried about Frank and he feels
                  that he needs to find out more.</li>
									<li>Dr Fixit leaves Frank’s house and returns
                  to his surgery, where he enters information about
                  the Care Event</li>
