PSIS Statement query response example.

This is the response to a "get event item by event item ID" call. It contains
the clinical statement for a given patient that corresponds to an event item ID.

The format of this response is almost identical to the "queryResponseSummary"
(get summary), but it will return a single statement rather than multiple
statements (in ACRS it may return multiple statements if PSIS is following links
to related statements as well as returning the original statement).

The metadata elements of this response are in the "urn:npfit:psisqr"
namespace, with the "psis" prefix. The original HL7 of the event is in the
"urn:hl7-org:v3" namespace, with no prefix.

		The HL7 data of the original event item is returned within the "hl7Data" element. It is 
		unchanged from the original form in which it was supplied to PSIS.

		It is possible that more than one clinical statement will be returned within this
		hl7Data element, if it has been treated as a single event item by PSIS. In PSIS ECRS,
		this will occur for direct (sourceOf3) relationships and organizer relationships.
		This example illustrates a clinical statement being returned that contains another
		via a direct relationship.

		The contents of the "hl7Data" element are within the HL7 namespace "urn:hl7-org:v3".
